### Tuts+ Course: Google Maps API
#### Instructor: David East

Get started creating interactive maps using the Google Maps API. In this course you'll learn how to create and configure different types of maps, how to attach events to these maps as well as creating and customizing markers. You'll tap into some of the more powerful services that Google provides, such as geocoding and then even abstract all of this out into your own custom library. By the end of this course, you'll be able to take the library you created and apply it to your own application.
